# Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Cognifyz Technologies Data Analysis Internship.  
The objective of this internship is to analyze a restaurant dataset and extract meaningful insights using Python and data analysis techniques.

The analysis is divided into multiple levels, where each level focuses on different aspects such as cuisines, ratings, city-based analysis, price range, online delivery, geographic distribution, and restaurant chains.
